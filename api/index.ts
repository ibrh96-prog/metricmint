/**
 * Vercel serverless function entry point.
 *
 * _bundle.cjs is generated during the Vercel build step (`pnpm build:api`) by
 * esbuild with --bundle, which inlines lib/db plus all npm dependencies, so no
 * monorepo symlinks need to exist at runtime.
 *
 * We `import` the CJS bundle (never `require`) so the ESM/CJS boundary is
 * handled by the loader — this avoids the ERR_REQUIRE_ESM crash. Files prefixed
 * with `_` are ignored by Vercel as their own routes but can be imported here.
