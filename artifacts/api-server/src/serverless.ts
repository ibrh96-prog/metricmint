/**
 * Serverless entry point for Vercel.
 *
 * Unlike src/index.ts (which calls app.listen for local/long-running use), this
 * module just builds the Express app and exports it as the default export. The
 * exported app is itself a (req, res) handler, which is exactly what a Vercel
 * Node serverless function expects.
 *
 * esbuild bundles this file (and lib/db plus all npm dependencies) into
 * api/_bundle.cjs.
